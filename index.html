    As defined in its <a href=
    "https://www.w3.org/2019/03/devices-sensors-wg-charter.html">charter</a>,
    the mission of the <em>Devices and Sensors Working Group</em>
    (DAS WG) is to create client-side APIs that enable the development of
    Web Applications that interact with device hardware and sensors. See
    the <a href="roadmap">roadmap</a> for details.
</p>
<p>
    The Working Group aims at gathering consensus on its specifications,
    both within the Working Group and with the community at large, working
    through an iterative process with implementors to ensure that the
    specifications are implementable and implemented. See also the <a href=
    "https://www.w3.org/Mobile/roadmap/">Roadmap of Web Applications on
    Mobile</a> on how this work fits in with the broader context of the
    Web platform.
